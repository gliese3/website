## First optical experiment preparations

### Done so far

1. <span style="color:green;">We got almost all the optical components needed for the first experiments (including windows, mirrors and lasers). </span>

2. <span style="color:orange;"> Laser chiller arrived with the Verdi V10 green laser last week has some damage. Investigation is in progress. </span>

3. <span style="color:green;"> Copper parts for the cryostat also arrived last week. Waiting for the new center plate. Copper rods to be ordered. </span>

### To be done soon

1. Testing attocube positioners at room temperature (soldering cables before).

2. Building Gas Handling System for the cryostat.

3. First ablation tests when foil arrives.

### Questions

1. Optical detector:
    - 500 - 900 nm: single photon counter _Excelitas SPCM-AQRH-14_ (already have it)
    {{< figure src="images/ProductPhoto_SPCM-AQRH-BR2-with-cage_RS.webp" title="Single photon counter">}}
    {{< figure src="images/2025-01-13_14-44.png" title="Efficiency">}}
    - 1000 - 1200 nm: <span style="color:orange;"> to be purchased </span>
